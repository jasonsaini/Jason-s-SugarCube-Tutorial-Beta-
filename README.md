# Jason-s-SugarCube-Tutorial-Beta-
This is a tutorial for those new to programming. Using the Twine interactive story framework, I have written a tutorial that uses basic programming concepts to help aspiring coders create their first interactive story!

In truth, I started this project as a reference for myself to use because I'm working on creating a Twine game!

I quickly realized its potential as a source for people to learn programming and web development basics and got to work writing and coding this tutorial in Sugarcube.

For those who don't know, SugarCube is a story format for Twine, a frameowrk for creating interactive stories.

Using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, we can create some cool effects to create a custom and unique story.

Please do not edit the relative file paths or folder/file names, because certain links won't show up properly.

I have also included a template for coders to start their own story, as well as external links for a deeper programming education!

Feel free to add tutorials for features!
