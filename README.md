# Jason-s-SugarCube-Tutorial-Beta-
This is a tutorial for those new to programming. Using the Twine interactive story framework, I have written a tutorial that uses basic programming concepts to help aspiring coders create their first interactive story!

Once you extract the main folder, be sure to extract the subfolder within it. Otherwise the project won't work properly...

In truth, I started this project as a reference for myself to use because I'm working on creating a Twine game!

I quickly realized its potential as a source for people to learn programming and web development basics and got to work writing and coding this tutorial in Sugarcube.

For those who don't know, SugarCube is a story format for Twine, a frameowrk for creating interactive stories.

Using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, we can create some cool effects to create a custom and unique story.

Please do not edit the relative file paths or folder/file names, because certain links won't show up properly.

I have also included a template for coders to start their own story, as well as external links for a deeper programming education!

It will throw an error because some files I mentioned in the template don't actually exist! They are placeholders for your custom audio files if you choose to use the template!

I strongly recommend you read the tutorial before experimenting with the template.

Feel free to add tutorials for features!
